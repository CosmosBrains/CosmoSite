Note from CosmosBrains:

Yeah I made all this effort FOR A PLACEHOLDER PAGE!?
I wasted three hours of my life.
Coding random text.
Composing the creepy soundtrack.
Writing all these messages.
Coding the random message system, so you get a new one every reload.
Figuring out a workaround for the audio because...
...modern day browsers just dont allow autoplay without user consent.
Coding the god dang button and making it play the song.

And the worst part? I'm not the only person on the entire planet...
who's ever gonna see this page. 

I going to be the only person who's going to see this comment.
Actually no... I'm going to be the only person who KNOWS about
this entire site. And I still spent three hours on this useless
placeholder page. Great use of my time.

Anyway, I know this message kinda ruins the whole "effect" a bit.
But look I'm losing it here and I wanted to put this somewhere.
The real question is what are you looking at my code for?
g e t  o u t


Oh also extra notes so I don't get cancelled so something:

Some of the "messages" are references. I mean it should be pretty clear but uh for instance:

The Star message is a reference to a line from a NPC in undertale. 
Yes I know its not the same. I wrote it differently.

Darker yet Darker is reference to Gaster deltarune.
no gaster is not in terrasphere

Some of them mention whistles, which is actually a reference
to a ROBLOX horror series surrounding such creatures.

The one that mentions a skybox and harddrive is a reference to level
404 from the Backrooms Wikidot (well actually as of writing it appears 
to be scheduled for a rewrite... but yeah it was a reference to the
orginal version).

The one mentioning something behind you is kinda a reference
to a unused room in Undertale.

The one stating to fight against the night is a reference to Interstellar

There is also one reference dark worlds in Deltarune.

That's not all of them but its a few, 
just to prove that THEY ARE references.
find the rest yourself idk
or not
idk
